            things are horribly broken right now. Maybe they will never be working again. Don't expect anything. I do this mostly to learn AngularJS.

        <strong>If you have a lot of subscriptions on YouTube</strong>, you know that it's
        hard to keep your sanity with the current interface, let alone the
        constant stream of user-hostile changes coming your way.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now, you <em>could</em> use a browser script to make the horrible "feeds"
        page a little easier on the eye&hellip; and always play catch-up with YouTube,
        <strong>or you could use YT Sanegrid</strong>.

    <ul>
        <li>It has a <span class="highlight">minimal, pleasant, full-screen</span> interface</li>
        <li>It <span class="highlight">never forgets a video</span> once it's in your subscription inbox</li>
        <li>You can <span class="highlight">mark an item as watched or hide it</span> with one click</li>
        <li>It has <span class="highlight">advanced features like automatic filters</span> based on keywords</li>
        <li>It's <span class="highlight">actively developed</span> and if you have a good idea, I'll put it in</li>
